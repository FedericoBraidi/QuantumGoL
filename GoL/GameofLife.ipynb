    "Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton, a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of complex systems through the evolution of a grid of cells based on a set of well-defined rules. It was first formulated by the British mathematician John Conway in 1970; at its core, the Game of Life operates on a two-dimensional grid, where each cell (which we will refer to using $S_{i,j}$) is in one of two states - alive (1) or dead (0). The evolution of the system is based on discrete time steps, also known as generations, where the state of each cell is determined by its 8 neighbouring cells (called Moore's neighbours).\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of the Game of Life are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Underpopulation:**\n",
    "   - If a live cell ($S_{i,j} = 1$) has fewer than two live neighbours, it dies in the next generation.\n",
    "   - Mathematical expression: $S_{i,j}^{(t+1)} = 0$ if $\\sum_{k,l} S_{k,l}^{(t)} < 2$, where $k, l$ are the indices of neighbouring cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Survival:**\n",
    "   - If a live cell has two or three live neighbours, it survives to the next generation.\n",
    "   - Mathematical expression: $S_{i,j}^{(t+1)} = S_{i,j}^{(t)}$ if $2 \\leq \\sum_{k,l} S_{k,l}^{(t)} \\leq 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overpopulation:**\n",
    "   - If a live cell has more than three live neighbuors, it dies in the next generation.\n",
    "   - Mathematical expression: $S_{i,j}^{(t+1)} = 0$ if $\\sum_{k,l} S_{k,l}^{(t)} > 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reproduction:**\n",
    "   - If a dead cell ($S_{i,j} = 0$) has exactly three live neighbours, it becomes alive in the next generation.\n",
    "   - Mathematical expression: $S_{i,j}^{(t+1)} = 1$ if $\\sum_{k,l} S_{k,l}^{(t)} = 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond its theoretical elegance, the Game of Life has practical applications in various scientific domains, including computer science, biology, and physics. Cellular automata, inspired by Conway's creation, continue to influence fields such as cryptography, image processing, and the simulation of natural phenomena. This set of rules mimics indeed the evolution of bacteria due to environmental conditions: if the environment is overpopulated or underpopulated the bacteria dies, while it reproduces if the conditions are optimal."

    "Many different types of patterns occur in the Game of Life, which are classified according to their behaviour. Common pattern types include: still lifes, which do not change from one generation to the next; oscillators, which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations; and spaceships, which translate themselves across the grid. We analyzed the most frequently occurring examples (meaning that they emerge frequently from a random starting configuration of cells) of each of those types. More complicated patterns require a bigger board and a lot of steps in order to become periodical."

Nevertheless, we noticed that for some initial configuration the evolution of the board resambles the one of a 'quantum cloud' that expands from a starting center; in most of the cases we analyse we arrive to the two possible stable conclusion, a stable form or a completly dead board.
